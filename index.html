I currently use a combination of a MacBook Pro Retina, Custom Built PC and an iPhone. I do not believe that I'm an "apple freak," however, they do often make some quality products. I must say, I am more attached to my custom built PC, it's my baby.One may ask why I have this section on my website, to which I would answer, well why not? My life is anchored in technology and everyday I am swimming in it. For a job, currently (8/25/13), I program. For said job I am writing an algorithm in python. Other languages I'm familiar with are C, C++, JavaScript (look at this sweet site made from scratch!), Objective C, x86 Assembly, and I can get by with most scripting languages. I no longer participate in the iOS jailbreak scene.

Who is "DanZ.im"? He's some dude located in Chicago who enjoys a combination of gaming, programming, physics, math and philosophy. Gaming wise, I do both PC gaming and console gaming (both PS3 and Xbox 360 - these will soon be outdated D:). Philosophy wise, I tend to be a fan of Ancient Greece, Plato and the such, however, I do enjoy a good read of more modern philosophers like Hobbes or Rousseau (yes, I'm aware they are opposites). In general, I keep busy; however, if you're in the Chicagoland region, ping me! We could grab lunch maybe!

I currently attend Loyola University Chicago. My declared majors are "Mathematics," "Physics," and "Theoretical Physics and Applied Mathematics," so, technically I'm a triple major although I really will only walk away with knowledge in math and physics. I pondered studying CS in college, but, that seems a bit silly considering I can already tutor everyone in CS classes (in other words, I already know what they would teach me). I plan to graduate in December of 2014. This might change to a semester later, considering the fact that graduate schools don't accept students during the winter. This brings me to graduate school: I plan on going for math/physics.

Welp, this is pretty much a "free game" page. You can contact me if you really need to at this address: </p><pre style="font-size:.9em;" id="emailaddy" title="Click to select">echo "wmg'%jx='qq%yqmgzq%xocq" | tr "meow%~+*'lkjqgcrtyui_p<>?=zx" "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz@."</pre><a id="mobileaddy">Email Me!</a><p class="platecontent">(it's a bash script, just c/p it into terminal, if you don't know how to do this then I suppose you'll have to find me in person). Other than that, nothing much to put here... I like cats... and dogs... meow.
